# TheCROWler Sources

TheCROWler use the concept of "sources" to define a website "entry-point" from
where to start the crawling, scrapping and interaction process.

A source is a combination of:

- a URL
- a crawling scope
- a flagset
- a configuration file (which is expressed in YAML format and has a well defined
  schema).

The configuration file is used to define the rulesets to be used for the source
and the interactions to be performed.

The flagset is used to define the flags to be used for the source.

The URL is the entry-point of the source.

A source can also be "enabled" or "disabled". If a source is "enabled", then it
will be used by TheCROWler. If a source is "disabled", then it will be ignored.

The crawling scope is used to define the scope of the crawling. The crawling
scope has 4 possible values:

- `page`: The crawling will be limited to the current page only (aka just the
  source entry-point).
- `FQDN`: The crawling will be limited to the current FQDN only (aka all the
  pages of the current FQDN, which includes the hostname, for example
  "www.example.com").
- `domain`: The crawling will be limited to the current domain only (aka all the
  pages of the current domain, which includes ALL found hostnames within the
  domain, for example "example.com").
- `l1 domain`: The crawling will be limited to the current l1 domain only (aka
  all the pages of the current l1 domain, which includes ALL found hostnames and
  ALL found subdomains within the l1 domain, for example ".com").
- `global`: The crawling will be global (aka all the pages of the current source
  and everything else on the entire internet that is linked from the source and
  then recursively crawled as well).

## Using addSource and removeSource commands

The `addSource` and `removeSource` commands are used to add and remove sources
from the source configuration.

To add a configuration with addSource, you have to write the configuration in a
YAML file and then use the `addSource` command to add the source pinpointing the
YAML file.

This will ensure that the source is added (or updated) in the DB and that the
configuration file is uploaded in the config field of the source.

To remove a source, you have to use the `removeSource` command and the URL of
the source you want to remove.

## Adding Sources configuration validation in VSCode

To add Sources configuration validation in VSCode, you can use the
following extension:

Open (or create) your VSCode settings.json file and add the following:

```json
"yaml.schemas": {
   "./schemas/crowler-source-config-schema.json": "*-sourcecfg.y*ml",
}
```

Then, ensure you call all your config files with the `-sourcecfg.yaml` or
`-sourcecfg.yml` extension.

This will allow you to validate your Sources configurations in VSCode
as you type them.
